## World Weather Analysis

# This analysis  was done using API calls -- 

* As the first step, I created a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes in Jupyter Notebook. 
* Using the citipy module, I retrieved the nearest city and performed an API call with the Open Weather Map. 
* I retrieved and added the following information using the API call to a dataframe: latitude, longitude, max temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, wind speed and weather description.
